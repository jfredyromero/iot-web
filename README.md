## What is in each file?
Let's dive into each directory.

### frontend:
- **public:** This subdirectory stores all public files like index.html and favicons
- **src:** This subdirectory stores the most important directories of Vue project
  - ***components:*** This subdirectory stores main components of the project
  - ***views:*** This subdirectory stores all components downloaded from the template
- **package.json:** DON'T REMOVE THIS OR ANY OTHER FILE IN THE REPOSITORY

### backend:

### Requirements.txt:
It's our task to upload this file

## How do I run the project?
At first, you need to have installed on your machine the most recent version of Node.js. You can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/es/

### frontend:

Open the command line interface and get into frontend directorie. Then run the following command:
>npm **install**

If thereÂ´s an error, run the following command:
>npm **install** --legacy-peer-deps

Now you've got all required dependencies and modules. Don't remove the node_modules directory.

Finally, for runnning the server project, you might type in this command:
>npm **run** **serve**

And that's all. Go to your browser, search for *localhost:8080* and you should be redirected to the main page of the web.
